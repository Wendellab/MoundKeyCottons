# Mound Key Wild Cotton

Ciation: [Ning, W., Rogers, K.M., Hsu, CY. et al. Origin and diversity of the wild cottons (*Gossypium hirsutum*) of Mound Key, Florida. Sci Rep 14, 14046 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64887-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64887-8)

This is needs some work to clean the code and put things in a logical ways! - Weixuan is on it  :shipit: 😝

### Codes following the data analysis order presented in the paper, including:

#### Pop gene analysis (PCA, NJ-tree, Structure)
1. Using [sentieon-dnaseq](https://github.com/Sentieon/sentieon-dnaseq.git), AD1 65 samples' raw reads trimming and mapping; GVCF calling; VCF calling; SNPs filtering.
2. Using biallelic SNPs to estimate population genetic groups via [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/) (PCA) and [LEA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/LEA.html).
3. Including additional two AD4 samples as outgroup, and calling bialleic SNPs from the 'combined' VCF with 65 AD1 samples, which include variable and invariable sites.

#### Genetic variation comparison (Pi, Dxy, Fst, He, Fis, LD)
1. [Pixy](https://github.com/ksamuk/pixy.git) was applied to 

#### Novel SNPs tabulating
1. Bcftools

#### MK cotton population demographic analysis (PCA, Tajima's D, SFS, Ne)
